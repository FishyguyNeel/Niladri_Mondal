My primary research area focuses on ecology and evolutionary pattern of fish. Outside of my PhD topics, I enjoy working on other projects for conservation and ecosystem management practices.

## Diversity of Fishes

For my PhD, I study body size diversity in teleost fishes. Fishes being the most diverse vertebrate animal (around 35,300 described species) in the world; they are very much suitable to work on the body size patterning. I use comperative phylogeny, morphology and evolutionary modelling to test different hypothesis.

## Physiochemical Parameters and Fish Diversity

I have been studying the relationship between fish diversity and physio-chemical parameters along with their distribution pattern in West Bengal,India.
This work is collaborated with [Deep Shankar Chini](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=75GmPXcAAAAJ)  from Vidyasagar University,India.
One of our study recently published which shows the water quality and fish diversity is linked with seasonal variability at the south western part of West Bengal in Bay of Bengal.

## Computational Characterization of Proteins

For my Masters' thesis, I worked on the fish proteins and their functions using in silico modelling and various docking and simulation software. Most of the works from my masters' are published and available online.

## Computational Characterization of Proteins

During my Bachelors', I worked on the diversity pattern of the birds of Southern part of West Bengal along with making a checklist. The preprint is on bioxriv and we will soon put it for publication in journal.
